# Earsketch

A place to consolidate some simple EarSketch demos I made in the event that I will expand upon or revisit them at a later date.

## Todo:
- [X] Make Repo
- [ ] Add some recorded sounds of my own instruments (alto/tenor sax, oboe, English Horn, etc) to use in sketches
- [ ] Use to teach applications of computer languages (python &/or JS) at library teen workshop
