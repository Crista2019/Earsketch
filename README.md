# Earsketch

A place to consolidate some simple EarSketch demos I made in the event that I will expand upon or revisit them at a later date.

<TODO> Add some recorded sounds of my own instruments (alto/tenor sax, oboe, English Horn, etc) and use in scripts
<TODO> Use to teach applications of computer languages (python &/or JS) at a library teen workshop
